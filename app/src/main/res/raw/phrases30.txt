the force is with you
i agree with you
thank you for your help
call for more details
have a good weekend
quit while you are ahead
life is but a dream
go out for some pizza and beer
exercise is good for the mind
want to join us for lunch
a problem with the engine
the world is a stage
do not say anything
are you sure you want this
time to go shopping
do not worry about this
all work and no play
the sum of the parts
are you talking to me
the living is easy
a quarter of a century
the price of gas is high
the kids are very excited
zero in on the facts
just in time for the party
the winner of the race
the capital of our nation
the dog will bite you
do not drink the water
it should be sunny tomorrow
