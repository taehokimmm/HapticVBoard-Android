the force is with you
call for more details
have a good weekend
the cotton is high
the world is a stage
thank you for your help
all work and no play
the sum of the parts
are you talking to me
the living is easy
the price of gas is high
just in time for the party
do not worry about this
are you sure you want this
the facts get in the way
the winner of the race
zero in on the facts
the capital of our nation
a problem with the engine
time to go shopping
i agree with you
with each step forward
the second largest country
the location of the crime
the minimum amount of time
did you have a good time
the children are playing
the dog will bite you
do not drink the water
he is still on our team
please follow the guidelines
you will loose your voice
come and see our new car
a quarter of a century
the kids are very excited
sad to hear that news
i will meet you at noon
this is a very good idea
life is but a dream
yes you are very smart
fall is my favorite season
you must be getting old
the library is closed today
what you see is what you get
play it again sam
join us on the patio
do not say anything
effort is what it will take
the sun rises in the east
the back yard of our house
communicate through email
well connected with people
peek out the window
he called seven times
quit while you are ahead
this person is a disaster
the four seasons will come
this is too much to handle
you should visit a doctor
want to join us for lunch
i like to play tennis
we run the risk of failure
i want to hold your hand
where did you get that tie
we drive on parkway
love means many things
teaching services will help
travel at the speed of light
just what the doctor ordered
it looks like a shack
