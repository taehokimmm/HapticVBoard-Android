the cotton is high
the world is a stage
thank you for your help
all work and no play
the sum of the parts
are you talking to me
the living is easy
the price of gas is high
just in time for the party
are you sure you want this
the facts get in the way
the winner of the race
zero in on the facts
the capital of our nation
a problem with the engine
time to go shopping
i agree with you
with each step forward
the second largest country
the location of the crime
the minimum amount of time

the children are playing
the dog will bite you

you must be getting old
just what the doctor ordered
if you were not so stupid
