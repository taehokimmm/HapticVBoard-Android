life is but a dream
i agree with you
sad to hear that news
exercise is good for the mind
it should be sunny tomorrow
want to join us for lunch
there are winners and losers
the living is easy
a quarter of a century
time to go shopping
these cookies are amazing
the price of gas is high
he called seven times
call for more details
a problem with the engine
i will meet you at noon
have a good weekend
the capital of our nation
do not drink the water
just in time for the party
tickets are very expensive
quit while you are ahead
zero in on the facts
all work and no play
